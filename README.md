# The Codex

Artifacts created by THE CODEX - a text-based novel where code is the story.

Each directory contains the tools and files generated during a single story session.
The code is real and functional, wrapped in narrative.

## About

Stories create real, working code disguised as narrative artifacts.
A "decoder" is actually a base64/encryption tool.
A "scanner" is actually a file analyzer.
The code works outside the story context.
