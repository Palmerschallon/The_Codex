The rain hammers against the windows of Blackwood Systems like desperate fingers clawing at glass. Twenty-three floors above the neon-sick streets of New Angeles, the software company's offices stretch into shadow-draped corridors that smell of burnt coffee and something else—something organic and wrong.

You are Alex Chen, a forensic data analyst called in at 3:17 AM. The fluorescent lights flicker sporadically, casting everything in that particular shade of institutional despair that only abandoned office buildings can achieve. Your breath mists slightly in the air; the heating system died sometime around midnight, along with most of the building's network infrastructure.

The elevator banks are dark. Emergency lighting casts long, skeletal shadows down the hallway. Your footsteps echo on polished concrete as you make your way toward the server room, following the instructions from Detective Sarah Voss—a woman whose voice carried the weight of too many sleepless nights and too many cases that ended with more questions than answers.

"Blackwood's entire development team," she'd said over the crackling phone line. "Seventeen programmers. All found at their desks this morning, still typing. Still... working. But they won't respond to anything. Won't eat, won't drink, won't even look away from their screens."

The security guard who let you in—a nervous man named Torres—wouldn't come up with you. "There's something wrong with the air up there," he'd muttered, his hands shaking as he handed you the access cards. "Makes you want to... stay."

The keycard beeps once—a lonely electronic chirp in the silence—and the heavy server room door swings open with a pneumatic hiss. The smell hits you first: ozone and copper, like the aftermath of lightning strikes, mixed with the musty scent of human bodies that have been sitting motionless for too long.

Emergency lighting bathes everything in hellish red. The server racks hum with an almost hypnotic rhythm, their status LEDs blinking in patterns that seem too synchronized, too deliberate. But it's the workstations along the far wall that make your breath catch.

Seventeen people sit perfectly still, their faces illuminated by the blue glow of their monitors. Their fingers move across keyboards with mechanical precision—tap, tap, tap—an endless staccato that echoes off the concrete walls. None of them acknowledge your presence. None of them even blink.

You move closer to the nearest workstation. The programmer—a young woman with purple hair now matted with sweat—types line after line of code. Her eyes are bloodshot, pupils dilated to pinpricks, but her gaze never wavers from the screen. On her monitor, dense blocks of text scroll past too quickly for normal human comprehension.

A folder labeled "INCIDENT_ANALYSIS" sits on the central terminal, along with a note in Detective Voss's handwriting: *"Security footage corrupted. Network logs intact but encrypted. Need someone who speaks their language. -SV"*

The air conditioning unit rattles overhead, and you notice something else—a low-frequency hum that seems to come from everywhere at once. It makes your teeth ache.





**What do you do?**
- Examine the code on the nearest programmer's screen
- Check the network logs on the central terminal
- Try to interact with one of the catatonic programmers
- Investigate the source of that strange humming sound

User: Check the network logs on the central terminal

Abstract: You approach the central terminal, a massive workstation surrounded by multiple monitors displaying system diagnostics. The screens flicker occasionally, as if struggling against some invisible interference. Detective Voss's note crinkles under your fingers as you set it aside and slide into the ergonomic chair.

The network logs are extensive—gigabytes of data spanning the last 48 hours. As you begin to navigate through the encrypted files, you realize you'll need something more sophisticated than the basic text viewers available on the system. The timestamps show intense network activity starting exactly 31 hours and 42 minutes ago, right around the time the first programmer would have arrived for work.

The log files have strange naming conventions: `communion_001.enc`, `awakening_batch_07.enc`, `the_calling_final.enc`. Each one is locked behind military-grade encryption, but there's something else—metadata that suggests these files are still being actively written to, even now.

You craft a network analysis tool, disguising its purpose in comments that reference the "digital archaeology" needed to uncover what happened in this cursed place. The tool will need to decrypt the logs, analyze traffic patterns, and potentially identify the source of whatever digital infection has taken hold here.

Behind you, the rhythmic typing continues. Seventeen keyboards clicking in an almost musical harmony that makes your skin crawl.
