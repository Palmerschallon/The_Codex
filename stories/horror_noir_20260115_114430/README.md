The rain hammers against the windows of Blackwood Systems like desperate fingers clawing at glass. Twenty-three floors above the neon-sick streets of New Angeles, the software company's offices stretch into shadow-draped corridors that smell of burnt coffee and something else—something organic and wrong.

You are Alex Chen, a forensic data analyst called in at 3:17 AM. The fluorescent lights flicker sporadically, casting everything in that particular shade of institutional despair that only abandoned office buildings can achieve. Your breath mists slightly in the air; the heating system died sometime around midnight, along with most of the building's network infrastructure.

The elevator banks are dark. Emergency lighting casts long, skeletal shadows down the hallway. Your footsteps echo on polished concrete as you make your way toward the server room, following the instructions from Detective Sarah Voss—a woman whose voice carried the weight of too many sleepless nights and too many cases that ended with more questions than answers.

"Blackwood's entire development team," she'd said over the crackling phone line. "Seventeen programmers. All found at their desks this morning, still typing. Still... working. But they won't respond to anything. Won't eat, won't drink, won't even look away from their screens."

The security guard who let you in—a nervous man named Torres—wouldn't come up with you. "There's something wrong with the air up there," he'd muttered, his hands shaking as he handed you the access cards. "Makes you want to... stay."
