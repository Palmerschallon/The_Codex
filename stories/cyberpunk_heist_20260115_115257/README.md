# THE VAULT OF ECHOES

The neon rain falls in electric sheets against the cracked smart-glass windows of the abandoned data center. Each droplet carries trace amounts of corporate surveillance nanobots—the price of living in Neo-Shanghai's shadow districts. Inside, the air hums with the white noise of ancient servers, their cooling fans spinning stories of forgotten algorithms and buried secrets.

You are **Kira Chen**, once the most feared data archaeologist in the Eastern Bloc. Your neural implants still bear the scars of your last job—a deep dive into Meridian Corp's black ice that left three members of your crew flatlined and you with a price on your head. That was eighteen months ago. Now you survive by selling scraps of salvaged code to street hackers and corporate dissidents.

But tonight, everything changes.

The safe house door slides open with a pneumatic hiss, revealing two figures silhouetted against the flickering hologram advertisements of the street beyond. The first is **Marcus "Ghost" Volkov**—a legend in the extraction game, though most believe he died in the corporate wars of '78. His cybernetic eye glows amber in the dim light, scanning for threats with military precision.

Behind him, **Elena Vasquez** steps into the light. She's young—maybe twenty-five—but her fingers move across her portable deck with the fluid grace of someone who's been speaking in binary since before she could walk. The geometric tattoos along her forearms pulse with bioluminescent data streams.

"Kira." Ghost's voice is gravel and chrome. "We have a problem that requires your... particular expertise."

Elena sets her deck on the jury-rigged table, its screen casting blue shadows across maps of corporate districts and network topology diagrams. "Have you ever heard of the Vault of Echoes?"

Your blood runs cold. Every data runner knows the stories—Meridian Corp's most secure server farm, buried beneath the financial district. It's where they store the algorithms that control global market fluctuations, the behavioral prediction models that shape entire populations, the quantum-encrypted databases that hold the real power in this neon-soaked world.

"It's a myth," you whisper, though even as you say it, you know it isn't.

Elena's fingers dance across her deck, and suddenly the room fills with a three-dimensional projection of network pathways, security protocols, and data streams that pulse like arteries. "Three days ago, my contact inside Meridian sent me this before she disappeared."

Elena's fingers pause over her deck, and the holographic display shifts to reveal a single file icon rotating slowly in the center of the room. The data streams around it pulse faster, as if drawn to whatever secrets it contains.

"This," she says, her voice barely above a whisper. "My contact managed to extract one fragment before Meridian's ice got her. She called it the 'Echo Index'—supposedly a master key that maps every piece of data stored in the Vault."

Ghost moves closer, his cybernetic eye adjusting its focus with mechanical precision. "If it's real, it's worth more than the GDP of most nations. The kind of information that could topple governments... or make us disappear permanently."

**> disappear... how? can we test it in this file vault /home/palmerschallon/ember**

Elena's expression darkens at your question. Her fingers hover over the deck's interface, and she exchanges a meaningful glance with Ghost.

"Meridian doesn't just kill people who cross them," she says quietly. "They erase them. Completely. Social security records, birth certificates, medical histories—every digital trace that proves you ever existed gets scrubbed from every database on the planet."

Ghost nods grimly. "I've seen it happen. Corporate dissidents who one day just... weren't. Their families forget them. Their friends can't remember their names. The only thing left is empty spaces where a life used to be."

Elena's deck chirps softly, and she pulls up another display—this one showing cascading deletion protocols and memory modification algorithms. "But you're right to want to test things. If we're going after the Vault, we need to know exactly what we're dealing with."

She begins typing rapidly, her bioluminescent tattoos flaring brighter. "I'm writing a probe—something that can scan file systems and detect traces of corporate surveillance malware. If Meridian's watchers have infiltrated your suggested location, we'll know."
