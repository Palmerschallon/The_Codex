# THE VAULT OF ECHOES

The neon rain falls in electric sheets against the cracked smart-glass windows of the abandoned data center. Each droplet carries trace amounts of corporate surveillance nanobots—the price of living in Neo-Shanghai's shadow districts. Inside, the air hums with the white noise of ancient servers, their cooling fans spinning stories of forgotten algorithms and buried secrets.

You are **Kira Chen**, once the most feared data archaeologist in the Eastern Bloc. Your neural implants still bear the scars of your last job—a deep dive into Meridian Corp's black ice that left three members of your crew flatlined and you with a price on your head. That was eighteen months ago. Now you survive by selling scraps of salvaged code to street hackers and corporate dissidents.

But tonight, everything changes.

The safe house door slides open with a pneumatic hiss, revealing two figures silhouetted against the flickering hologram advertisements of the street beyond. The first is **Marcus "Ghost" Volkov**—a legend in the extraction game, though most believe he died in the corporate wars of '78. His cybernetic eye glows amber in the dim light, scanning for threats with military precision.

Behind him, **Elena Vasquez** steps into the light. She's young—maybe twenty-five—but her fingers move across her portable deck with the fluid grace of someone who's been speaking in binary since before she could walk. The geometric tattoos along her forearms pulse with bioluminescent data streams.

"Kira." Ghost's voice is gravel and chrome. "We have a problem that requires your... particular expertise."

Elena sets her deck on the jury-rigged table, its screen casting blue shadows across maps of corporate districts and network topology diagrams. "Have you ever heard of the Vault of Echoes?"

Your blood runs cold. Every data runner knows the stories—Meridian Corp's most secure server farm, buried beneath the financial district. It's where they store the algorithms that control global market fluctuations, the behavioral prediction models that shape entire populations, the quantum-encrypted databases that hold the real power in this neon-soaked world.

"It's a myth," you whisper, though even as you say it, you know it isn't.

Elena's fingers dance across her deck, and suddenly the room fills with a three-dimensional projection of network pathways, security protocols, and data streams that pulse like arteries. "Three days ago, my contact inside Meridian sent me this before she disappeared."
