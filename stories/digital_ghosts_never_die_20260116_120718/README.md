The rain hammers against the grimy windows of the Meridian Research Station's data recovery lab, each drop like a morse code message from the storm-torn night. You are **Dr. Elena Vasquez**, and three months ago, your life's work vanished into digital smoke.

The quantum communications project. Five years of research. Gone.





The lab feels different now—colder, emptier. Banks of servers hum in the darkness, their LED arrays casting an eerie blue glow across scattered papers and coffee-stained notebooks. The official investigation concluded "system failure," but you know better. Someone wanted your research buried.

Dr. Marcus Chen emerges from behind a tower of backup drives, his usually neat appearance disheveled. Dark circles rim his eyes. "Elena, I've been here all night. I found something." His voice carries a tremor of excitement mixed with fear. "Hidden filesystem fragments. The data wasn't destroyed—it was *hidden*."

He gestures toward a workstation where fragments of code scroll across multiple monitors. "But it's protected by layers of encryption I've never seen before. We'll need tools... sophisticated ones."

Thunder crashes outside, and the lights flicker. In that brief darkness, you notice something that wasn't there before—a USB drive, barely visible, tucked behind a keyboard on the far workstation. Marcus follows your gaze.

"That wasn't there when I arrived," he whispers.

The station feels suddenly less empty. Someone else has been here tonight.
