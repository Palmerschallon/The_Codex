# THE BRASS CONVERGENCE

The year is 1934, and the world runs on coal smoke and copper wires, brass gears and diesel dreams. In the industrial heart of New Cascadia, where pneumatic tubes snake between towering factories and airships drift between steam-wreathed spires, something extraordinary has been discovered.





The old Meridian Foundry stands like a cathedral of industry, its brass-fitted windows catching the amber glow of the setting sun. Steam hisses from relief valves, and the rhythmic *thump-thump-thump* of the great diesel engines echoes through the cavernous space. But today, the foundry serves a different purpose—it's been converted into the workshop of Victoria Brassheart, the city's most notorious inventor and code-breaker.

Victoria adjusts her brass-rimmed goggles and wipes grease-stained hands on her leather apron. Her mechanical arm—a marvel of clockwork and hydraulics—clicks softly as she reaches for a peculiar device on her workbench. It's a brass cylinder covered in switches and dials, connected to what appears to be a primitive computational engine built from telephone switchboards and punch-card readers.

"Fascinating," she murmurs, her voice carrying the slight accent of someone who's spent years in the academic halls of Europa before coming to this industrial frontier. "These signals... they're not random at all."

You are Detective Ray Kessler, formerly of the Metropolitan Police, now working freelance in the gray areas where crime meets cutting-edge technology. Victoria called you here because she's discovered something in the electromagnetic spectrum—coded transmissions that seem to be coordinating activities across the city's industrial district. Activities that have been leaving a trail of missing engineers and sabotaged factories.

Victoria's mechanical fingers dance across a keyboard she's jury-rigged to her signal analyzer, a device that captures and decodes the various radio frequencies bouncing between the city's forest of transmission towers. She's been working on something that can not only intercept these mysterious signals but decode them in real-time.

The brass analyzer hums with electric tension as Victoria's mechanical fingers pause over the keyboard. Steam from the foundry's pipes creates writhing shadows on the workshop walls, and somewhere in the distance, a factory whistle screams its end-of-shift warning.

"Ray," Victoria says, not looking up from her device, "I've been tracking these transmissions for three weeks now. Every time one appears, an engineer vanishes or a factory suffers a convenient 'accident.'" Her brass goggles reflect the amber glow of vacuum tubes as data streams across a series of mechanical counters. "But tonight... tonight they're different."

The signal interceptor she's built chirps and clicks, punch cards feeding through its mechanical brain. Victoria has created something remarkable—a device that doesn't just capture radio frequencies, but analyzes their patterns, looking for the mathematical signatures that betray encrypted communications.

# THE BRASS CONVERGENCE DEEPENS

You notice Victoria's expression shift as she studies the readouts from her analyzer. The foundry's diesel engines seem to pulse in rhythm with the blinking lights on her device, creating an almost hypnotic atmosphere thick with coal smoke and possibility.

"You're right, Ray," she says, her mechanical arm whirring as it adjusts dials with impossible precision. "There *is* a pattern. But it's not just in the radio frequencies—it's in everything. The missing engineers, the factory sabotages, even the timing of the airship schedules above us."

She gestures toward a large brass-plated board mounted on the foundry wall, covered in photographs, newspaper clippings, and colored string connecting various points across a map of New Cascadia. Red pins mark the locations of disappeared engineers, while black pins show sabotaged facilities.

"Look at this constellation of incidents," Victoria continues, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. "Someone—or some organization—is systematically targeting specific industrial capabilities. They're not random attacks. They're surgical strikes designed to cripple particular types of manufacturing."

Through the foundry's tall windows, you can see the city's skyline: massive cooling towers releasing steam into the twilight, transmission towers bristling with electrical connections, and the occasional dirigible drifting between the industrial spires like a whale navigating coral reefs.

Suddenly, Victoria's signal analyzer erupts in a cascade of clicking sounds. Her eyes widen behind her brass goggles.

"Ray... they're transmitting *right now*. And the signal is coming from inside the city. Close. Very close."

**What do you do?**

A) Rush outside to triangulate the transmission source using Victoria's portable signal detector
B) Study the pattern board more carefully to identify what type of facility might be the next target
C) Ask Victoria about the specific engineers who've disappeared—there might be a connection she's missed
D) Suggest investigating the foundry itself—what if the signal is coming from inside this very building?

# THE HUNT BEGINS



The brass-fitted doors of the foundry slam open as you and Victoria burst into the coal-scented evening air. She clutches a portable version of her signal analyzer—a briefcase-sized contraption of brass tubes, copper wire antennas, and what appears to be a miniature version of her punch-card processing system.

"This way!" Victoria shouts over the industrial symphony of New Cascadia's evening shift change. Her mechanical arm extends a telescoping antenna as she follows the device's directional indicators. Steam hisses from manholes, and the rhythmic *clank-clank* of pneumatic message tubes echoes between the buildings.

You follow her through the maze of industrial streets, past workers streaming out of factories, their faces blackened with coal dust and machine oil. Overhead, the skeletal framework of transmission towers creates a spider web against the darkening sky, while dirigibles drift between them like sleeping giants.

Victoria's detector grows more frantic, its brass dials spinning wildly as you approach the old Meridian Research Station—a seven-story building of riveted steel and brass fittings, crowned with an array of communication equipment that seems far too sophisticated for 1934. The building appears abandoned, its windows dark except for a faint amber glow emanating from the upper floors.

"The signal's strongest here," Victoria whispers, her breath visible in the cooling air. Her device has been quietly building a complete frequency analysis and location tracking system as you moved through the city.

As you watch the building, you notice something unsettling: despite appearing abandoned, there are fresh tire tracks in the coal dust near the loading dock, and one of the building's service elevators is moving—its brass floor indicators slowly climbing toward the seventh floor.

# THE PURSUIT THROUGH BRASS AND STEAM



The brass-fitted doors of the foundry slam open as you and Victoria burst into the coal-scented evening air. She clutches a portable version of her signal analyzer—a briefcase-sized contraption of brass tubes, copper wire antennas, and what appears to be a miniature version of her punch-card processing system.

"The frequency's shifting!" Victoria calls out, her goggles reflecting the amber glow of the street lamps. "They know we're listening!" Her mechanical arm adjusts dials with inhuman precision while her flesh hand grips the device's leather handle.

You sprint through the industrial maze of New Cascadia, past workers emerging from the evening shift change. The air thick with coal smoke and the metallic tang of ozone from the city's electrical grid. Victoria's device emits a steady *tick-tick-tick* that grows more urgent as you weave between pneumatic tube stations and steam-powered delivery trucks.

"This way!" She banks left down Copper Avenue, her analyzer leading you toward the darker industrial sector where the foundries give way to more secretive enterprises. The signal seems to be originating from somewhere near the old Meridian Research Station—that mysterious seven-story edifice crowned with an array of transmission equipment far too advanced for 1934.

Victoria works frantically as you move, connecting additional components to her portable analyzer. She's creating something that can not only track these elusive signals but predict where they'll appear next.
