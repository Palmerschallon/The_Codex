# THE BRASS CONVERGENCE

The year is 1934, and the world runs on coal smoke and copper wires, brass gears and diesel dreams. In the industrial heart of New Cascadia, where pneumatic tubes snake between towering factories and airships drift between steam-wreathed spires, something extraordinary has been discovered.





The old Meridian Foundry stands like a cathedral of industry, its brass-fitted windows catching the amber glow of the setting sun. Steam hisses from relief valves, and the rhythmic *thump-thump-thump* of the great diesel engines echoes through the cavernous space. But today, the foundry serves a different purpose—it's been converted into the workshop of Victoria Brassheart, the city's most notorious inventor and code-breaker.

Victoria adjusts her brass-rimmed goggles and wipes grease-stained hands on her leather apron. Her mechanical arm—a marvel of clockwork and hydraulics—clicks softly as she reaches for a peculiar device on her workbench. It's a brass cylinder covered in switches and dials, connected to what appears to be a primitive computational engine built from telephone switchboards and punch-card readers.

"Fascinating," she murmurs, her voice carrying the slight accent of someone who's spent years in the academic halls of Europa before coming to this industrial frontier. "These signals... they're not random at all."

You are Detective Ray Kessler, formerly of the Metropolitan Police, now working freelance in the gray areas where crime meets cutting-edge technology. Victoria called you here because she's discovered something in the electromagnetic spectrum—coded transmissions that seem to be coordinating activities across the city's industrial district. Activities that have been leaving a trail of missing engineers and sabotaged factories.

Victoria's mechanical fingers dance across a keyboard she's jury-rigged to her signal analyzer, a device that captures and decodes the various radio frequencies bouncing between the city's forest of transmission towers. She's been working on something that can not only intercept these mysterious signals but decode them in real-time.

The brass analyzer hums with electric tension as Victoria's mechanical fingers pause over the keyboard. Steam from the foundry's pipes creates writhing shadows on the workshop walls, and somewhere in the distance, a factory whistle screams its end-of-shift warning.

"Ray," Victoria says, not looking up from her device, "I've been tracking these transmissions for three weeks now. Every time one appears, an engineer vanishes or a factory suffers a convenient 'accident.'" Her brass goggles reflect the amber glow of vacuum tubes as data streams across a series of mechanical counters. "But tonight... tonight they're different."

The signal interceptor she's built chirps and clicks, punch cards feeding through its mechanical brain. Victoria has created something remarkable—a device that doesn't just capture radio frequencies, but analyzes their patterns, looking for the mathematical signatures that betray encrypted communications.
