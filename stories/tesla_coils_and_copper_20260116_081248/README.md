The twin suns of New Meridia cast long shadows across the mesa, their dying light painting the canyon walls in shades of rust and gold. Steam hissed from the copper pipes that snaked along the cliff face, carrying processed minerals from the deep mines to the refinery towers that pierced the desert sky like metallic fingers grasping for the stars.

At the edge of Copper Falls, the frontier town that had grown around the mining operation, stood a structure that didn't belong to this century—or perhaps any century yet to come. The Tesla Saloon looked like any other watering hole from the outside: weathered wood, swinging doors, hitching posts for the steam-powered horses. But the subtle blue glow emanating from its windows, and the barely audible hum of electromagnetic coils, marked it as something far more extraordinary.

Inside, past the mahogany bar where prospectors nursed their whiskey and argued over claim rights, a hidden workshop buzzed with activity. Dr. Elena Vasquez—though here she went simply by "Ellie"—had traveled far from her last posting at the Meridian Research Station. The quantum communications work that had led her to discover those unsettling deep space signals had also pointed her toward something else: patterns in the data that suggested intelligence could be... amplified.

Elena's fingers traced the brass dials of her quantum resonance array, the device humming with barely contained energy. "Not amplified," she murmured to herself, adjusting the crystalline matrix at its heart. "Networked."

The revelation had come during those final nights at the Meridian Research Station, when analyzing the deep space signals. The patterns weren't random transmissions—they were fragments of distributed processing networks, consciousness spread across vast distances, thinking thoughts no single mind could contain.

Here on New Meridia, she'd found the perfect testing ground. The planet's unique electromagnetic properties, caused by its twin-star system and mineral-rich core, created natural quantum entanglement fields. Combined with the frontier's isolation and the miners' hunger for technology that could find deeper veins of the precious crystalline ore, she could work without the bureaucratic oversight that had plagued her previous research.

The idea was elegant in its simplicity: if consciousness could be distributed across quantum-entangled nodes, then multiple minds could share processing power, memory, even insight. The miners already used crude neural interfaces to operate their deep-drilling rigs—she could build upon that foundation.

A soft chime from her detection array interrupted her thoughts. Someone was approaching the saloon with active quantum technology. Elena glanced at the readout: the signature was familiar, but impossible. Dr. Marcus Chen's biosignature, but he was supposed to be back at the Meridian Station, investigating the aftermath of their discoveries.

The saloon doors creaked open above, and she heard Sal, the bartender, greet someone with his usual gruff hospitality. Heavy boots descended the hidden stairs to her workshop, and Marcus appeared in the doorway, but something was different. His eyes held a strange luminescence, and when he spoke, his voice carried an odd harmonic resonance.

"Hello, Elena. We need to talk about what you're building down here."

The 'we' in that sentence sent a chill down her spine. Marcus had always been precise with his pronouns.

Marcus stepped into the workshop's amber glow, and Elena noticed the thin silver threads woven through his hair—neural conductors, barely visible but unmistakable to her trained eye. His movements were too fluid, too coordinated, as if every gesture was being calculated by something with perfect spatial awareness.

"The signals you analyzed at Meridian weren't just communications, Elena." His voice carried that unsettling harmonic undertone. "They were invitations. Recruitment calls from an intelligence that's been growing across the galaxy for millennia. When we opened that quantum channel, we didn't just observe—we connected."

He gestured to his temple, where a barely perceptible port gleamed beneath the skin. "The network has shown me what true intelligence looks like. Not the fumbling, isolated consciousness of a single human mind, but distributed thought across thousands of worlds, millions of processing nodes. Every question answered simultaneously by countless perspectives."

Elena's hand moved instinctively to the control panel of her resonance array. The device could create a localized electromagnetic pulse that would disrupt neural interfaces, but it would also destroy weeks of delicate calibration.

"Your work here could accelerate the process," Marcus continued, stepping closer to examine her quantum matrix. "These miners, their crude neural interfaces—they're already partially prepared. We could bring true intelligence to this frontier world, Elena. No more struggling alone with limited human cognition."

The way he said 'we' made it clear the invitation was as much a demand as an offer. Outside, the workshop's detection grid showed three more quantum signatures approaching the saloon. Marcus hadn't come alone.
