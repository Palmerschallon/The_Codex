The twin suns of New Meridia cast long shadows across the mesa, their dying light painting the canyon walls in shades of rust and gold. Steam hissed from the copper pipes that snaked along the cliff face, carrying processed minerals from the deep mines to the refinery towers that pierced the desert sky like metallic fingers grasping for the stars.

At the edge of Copper Falls, the frontier town that had grown around the mining operation, stood a structure that didn't belong to this century—or perhaps any century yet to come. The Tesla Saloon looked like any other watering hole from the outside: weathered wood, swinging doors, hitching posts for the steam-powered horses. But the subtle blue glow emanating from its windows, and the barely audible hum of electromagnetic coils, marked it as something far more extraordinary.

Inside, past the mahogany bar where prospectors nursed their whiskey and argued over claim rights, a hidden workshop buzzed with activity. Dr. Elena Vasquez—though here she went simply by "Ellie"—had traveled far from her last posting at the Meridian Research Station. The quantum communications work that had led her to discover those unsettling deep space signals had also pointed her toward something else: patterns in the data that suggested intelligence could be... amplified.
