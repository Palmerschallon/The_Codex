## Chapter One: Signal From Beyond

The Meridian Research Station perches on the edge of Antarctica like a metallic insect frozen mid-crawl. Three months of polar night stretch ahead, and Dr. Elena Vasquez knows that the darkness outside is nothing compared to what lurks in the data streams flowing through the station's quantum processors.

The coffee in her thermal mug has gone cold hours ago, but Elena doesn't notice. Her eyes burn from staring at the cascading lines of intercepted signals—fragments of something vast and incomprehensible that began appearing in their deep space monitoring arrays six days ago. The patterns don't match any known astronomical phenomena. They pulse with a mathematical precision that suggests intelligence, but one so alien that it makes her skin crawl.

"Still chasing ghosts, Vasquez?"

Dr. Marcus Chen slides into the workstation beside her, his breath visible in the perpetually cold air. The station's heating system has been failing for weeks—another symptom of the growing list of malfunctions that started when the signals began.

"These aren't ghosts," Elena mutters, fingers dancing across her keyboard. "Look at this frequency analysis."

> *Elena writes a signal analyzer—a tool to detect artificial patterns in deep space radio data. The code materializes as [`signal_analyzer.py`](signal_analyzer.py), using FFT analysis and peak detection to identify non-natural origins.*

## Chapter Two: The Language of Unmaking

Elena's fingers tremble as she opens a new terminal window. The rational part of her mind screams that they should shut everything down, evacuate, call for help. But the scientist in her—the part that has spent her entire career chasing signals from the void—knows that understanding comes before survival.

"Elena, what are you doing?" Marcus backs away from her workstation, his breath forming desperate puffs in the frigid air. "We need to get out of here."

"No." Her voice is steady despite the terror clawing at her throat. "If we're broadcasting these signals, then something is using our equipment to communicate. We need to know what it's trying to say."

The aurora outside pulses brighter, and she can swear she sees geometric patterns writhing in the green fire—fractals that seem to extend into dimensions her eyes can't quite follow.

## ⚡ Decision Point

*The story pauses here. What does Elena do next?*

| Option | Path |
|--------|------|
| **A** | Build a decoder to understand the signal |
| **B** | Shut down all equipment and evacuate |
| **C** | Try to communicate back |
| **D** | Search the station for the source |
