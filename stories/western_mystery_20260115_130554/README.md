# THE GHOST IN THE WIRES

The dust never settles in Copper Creek. It hangs in the air like secrets, coating everything with the red grit of broken dreams and buried gold. But today, something else cuts through that perpetual haze - the sharp, urgent *tap-tap-tap* of morse code echoing from the telegraph office.

You stand on the wooden boardwalk outside Hendricks & Associates Telegraph Company, watching Sarah Hendricks through the grimy window. Her fingers dance across the brass telegraph key with mechanical precision, but there's something wrong in the rhythm. A stutter. A hesitation that speaks of fear.

The year is 1887, and the copper mines that gave this Arizona territory town its name are playing out. Most folks are packing up, heading back east or further west to chase new fortunes. But the telegraph lines - they're busier than ever. Messages flowing like digital blood through copper arteries, carrying the hopes and schemes of a dying frontier.

Sarah looks up as the door creaks open, her dark eyes reflecting the amber glow of the oil lamps. At twenty-six, she's one of the few women in the territory who can speak the electric language fluently. Her father built this office before consumption took him last winter, leaving her to tend the wires alone.

"Thank God you're here," she whispers, glancing nervously at the telegraph apparatus. "Something's wrong with the messages. They're... different. Coded in ways I've never seen. And they're all coming from the abandoned Blackrock Mine."

She slides a crumpled piece of paper across the counter. Columns of seemingly random letters and numbers fill the page, but underneath her transcription, someone has been making notes in the margins - frequency counts, pattern analysis, fragments of words.

"Started three days ago. Same time every night - 9:17 PM exactly. The patterns repeat, but they're too complex for any standard cipher I know. And there's no telegraph line to Blackrock anymore. That equipment was pulled out two years ago when the mine closed."

The lamplight flickers across Sarah's worried features as she continues, "I've been trying to make sense of these messages myself, but..." She gestures helplessly at the cryptic symbols. "My father, he used to say the desert keeps its secrets in copper and code. Maybe he was more right than he knew."

Outside, the wind picks up, rattling the loose boards of the telegraph office. The sound of spurs on wooden planks echoes from somewhere down the street - late riders in a town that's learned to distrust strangers after dark.

Sarah leans closer, her voice dropping to barely above a whisper. "There's something else. Yesterday, I saw lights moving around the old mine shaft. Not lanterns - something brighter, more... electric. And today, Jake Morrison's horse came back without him. He was heading up to Blackrock, said he had business there."

She opens a leather-bound ledger, revealing pages of her careful handwriting - timestamps, message fragments, and detailed observations. "I've been keeping records of everything. My father taught me that patterns tell stories, if you know how to listen."

The telegraph key suddenly springs to life with a sharp *tap-tap-tap*, making you both jump. Sarah's hand moves instinctively toward the apparatus, then stops.

"It's starting again," she breathes. "Same time as always, even though it's early tonight."
