# THE GHOST IN THE WIRES

The dust never settles in Copper Creek. It hangs in the air like secrets, coating everything with the red grit of broken dreams and buried gold. But today, something else cuts through that perpetual haze - the sharp, urgent *tap-tap-tap* of morse code echoing from the telegraph office.

You stand on the wooden boardwalk outside Hendricks & Associates Telegraph Company, watching Sarah Hendricks through the grimy window. Her fingers dance across the brass telegraph key with mechanical precision, but there's something wrong in the rhythm. A stutter. A hesitation that speaks of fear.

The year is 1887, and the copper mines that gave this Arizona territory town its name are playing out. Most folks are packing up, heading back east or further west to chase new fortunes. But the telegraph lines - they're busier than ever. Messages flowing like digital blood through copper arteries, carrying the hopes and schemes of a dying frontier.

Sarah looks up as the door creaks open, her dark eyes reflecting the amber glow of the oil lamps. At twenty-six, she's one of the few women in the territory who can speak the electric language fluently. Her father built this office before consumption took him last winter, leaving her to tend the wires alone.

"Thank God you're here," she whispers, glancing nervously at the telegraph apparatus. "Something's wrong with the messages. They're... different. Coded in ways I've never seen. And they're all coming from the abandoned Blackrock Mine."

She slides a crumpled piece of paper across the counter. Columns of seemingly random letters and numbers fill the page, but underneath her transcription, someone has been making notes in the margins - frequency counts, pattern analysis, fragments of words.

"Started three days ago. Same time every night - 9:17 PM exactly. The patterns repeat, but they're too complex for any standard cipher I know. And there's no telegraph line to Blackrock anymore. That equipment was pulled out two years ago when the mine closed."
