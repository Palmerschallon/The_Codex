NOTES:
- Messages always exactly 14 groups of 4 letters
- Sequence appears to rotate/shift
- No standard telegraph codes
- Source: Unknown (Blackrock Mine line disconnected 1885)
- Electric disturbances noted during transmission
- Horse tracks seen near old relay station morning after each message

Pattern analysis needed. Father's cipher books no help.
Something is very wrong here.
